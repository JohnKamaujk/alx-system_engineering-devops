# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage

## Issue Summary:

**Duration:**  
Start Time: October 15, 2023, 10:30 AM (UTC)  
End Time: October 15, 2023, 12:45 PM (UTC)

**Impact:**  
The outage affected our web application, causing a complete service unavailability for approximately 30% of our users. Users experienced slow response times, timeouts, and intermittent errors during the outage.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the outage was identified as a database connection issue. A misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings led to a gradual degradation of performance, ultimately resulting in a complete service disruption.

## Timeline:

- **Detection Time:**  
  October 15, 2023, 10:30 AM (UTC)

- **Detection Method:**  
  Automated monitoring detected an increase in response time and a spike in error rates.

- **Actions Taken:**  
  1. The operations team was alerted immediately upon the automated detection.
  2. Initial investigation focused on the web servers, assuming the issue might be related to increased traffic.
  3. Misleadingly, some time was spent investigating the possibility of a DDoS attack due to the sudden surge in traffic.
  4. As the issue persisted, attention shifted to the database layer.
  5. Database connection logs were analyzed, revealing a surge in failed connection attempts.
  6. The incident was escalated to the database administration team.

- **Escalation:**  
  The incident was escalated to the database administration team 45 minutes into the outage.

- **Resolution:**  
  Database administrators reconfigured the connection pool settings to accommodate the increased load, resolving the issue.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings. The pool size was set too low, leading to exhausted connections during peak usage.

**Resolution:**  
The issue was resolved by adjusting the database connection pool settings to allow for a higher number of concurrent connections. This change was implemented without requiring a system restart, minimizing downtime.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Improvements/Fixes:**
1. **Automated Scaling:** Implement automated scaling for the database connection pool to dynamically adjust based on usage patterns.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase granularity in monitoring to detect performance issues at an earlier stage.

**Tasks:**
1. **Database Configuration Review:** Conduct a comprehensive review of all database configuration settings to identify and rectify potential bottlenecks.
2. **Load Testing:** Perform rigorous load testing to simulate peak traffic conditions and ensure system resilience.
3. **Documentation Update:** Update documentation regarding database configuration best practices to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.

In conclusion, this outage provided valuable insights into the importance of robust monitoring and a systematic approach to issue resolution. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we aim to fortify our system against similar incidents in the future. Learning from this experience, we are committed to continuous improvement in our infrastructure to deliver a more reliable service to our users.
